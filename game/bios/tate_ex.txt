"Don't underestimate me."

A defector from a violent cult who grew disgusted with their clan's practices. While Tate is physically weak, they do possess some magical abilities. After being ostracized since childhood for protesting every conquest undertaken by the cult and for being unable to win in a "real" fight, out of fear for their life, Tate fled.

Tate strives to live a peaceful life, posing as a human, despite constantly battling the echoes of their past. They are a pacifist at heart, but they won't turn down a friendly challenge.
