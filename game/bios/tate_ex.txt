"Don't underestimate me."

A defector from a violent cult who was disgusted with their tribe's practices. Instead, Tate studied less baneful forms of magic in secret and was eventually able to acquire forbidden knowledge from the outside world.

Ashamed of the destruction their people has wrought, Tate fled their realm through a sort of magical wormhole, and has been living as a human under their new name ever since. All they want now is a peaceful life, but they keep getting dragged into CS's shenanigans...
