"The most important character"

Hi guys! It's me, the sticky note, remember? I mean, how could you forget! I'm the most important character in the game! Remember when I told CS to delete the CScord, and how the Discord route was the coolest route in the game? Yeah, I know. It's super cool. Hey wait, CS, what are you doing? Why are you throwing me awayyyyy.....
