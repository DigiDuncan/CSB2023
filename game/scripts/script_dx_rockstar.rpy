    n "CS is relaxing at home, listening to a vinyl."
    cs "Ah, it's good to just kick back and listen to some tunes."
    n "Suddenly, his phone rings!"
    cs "Oh shi--"
    cs "Who could that be? I'm not expecting a call today."

    # Pause vinyl
    n "CS turns off the record player and answers the phone."

    # Howie appears on screen with a different background to represent this phone call.
    cs "Hello?"
    # Do we have a Howie Motif? Maybe we should? IDK music should play here.
    howie "Hey, CS, it's Howie. How's it hanging?"
    cs "Howie? It's been a while! I'm doing well, just relaxing after the crazy adventure I went on."
    howie "Good, good, glad to hear you've been getting that R&R, because I just might throw a wrench in that plan."
    cs "A wren-- wait, what do you mean?"
    howie "A bit of a twist in the schism, a knot in your drawstrings, you dig?"
    cs "No?"
    howie "Ah, come on, man, you know what I'm sayin'. I think it's time for that album, yeah?"
    cs "Album? I... didn't we make an album?"
    howie "Nah, man, that was just an EP! Sure, it's a great way to get your name out there, but now it's out there! It's out and about! It's time to capture that magic."
    cs "Howie, I appreciate it, I do, but [band_name] hasn't recorded anything since the tour, and I just don't know how easy it'll be to get everyone back together."
    howie "It's just you, Diet Cobain, and Fluffy Butt, right? Surely you three can find some time to make some dimes!"
    cs "I don't really need the money... we made quite a bit off that tour, and I still make money from YouTube Poops."
    howie "It's not about the money, baby! It's about the love of the craft, the feeling in your soul, the jazz up your--"
    cs "OK, OK, I get it. I'll give it some thought."
    howie "Well once you've thought enough thinks and drank enough drinks, hit me up. I got a pretty sweet deal on the table for both of us if ya do."

    # Bye, Howie. End Howie music.
    n "The phone hangs up."
    n "CS sets his phone down in thought."
    cs "[band_name] making an album again? I mean sure, I joked about [album_name] 2, but..."
    n "CS turns back on the vinyl he was listening to."

    # Turn back on the vinyl
