##### DEFAULT / ALL #####

(Since these are the defaults, you can just call as credits_roll() and call it a day if you're not changing anything.)

credits_roll(route = "All", bgm = "goodbye_summer_hello_winter.ogg", scroll_start = 25500, scroll_end = 1075, duration = 343)

##### CHRISTMAS ####
(ADJUST THESE WHEN YOU GET YOUR REAL CREDITS MUSIC IN)

credits_roll(route="CSBIII DX: Holiday Special", bgm="hohsis_theme.ogg", scroll_start = 12000, duration=30)
